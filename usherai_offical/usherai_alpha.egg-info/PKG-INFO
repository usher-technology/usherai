# Usherai Summary  
Usherai is an easy-to-use Python module that simplifies OpenAI's artificial intelligence API for Python developers. Our module includes five simple AI-powered Python functions that can easily integrate AI into any of your Python projects (including text to speech). In order to use Usherai, you will need an OpenAI secret key that can be accessed after creating an OpenAI developer account at openai.com. Once you have access to your secret key, simply copy and paste the key into the Usherai class input and you're good to go! Created by Bertran Usher Jr.
